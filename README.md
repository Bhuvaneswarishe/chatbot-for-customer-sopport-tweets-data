# Intelligent Customer Support Chatbot

This project demonstrates an intelligent customer support chatbot designed to understand user queries and provide accurate responses using advanced NLP techniques such as text classification, named entity recognition (NER), and Hugging Face's Transformers.

## Features

- **Intent Recognition**: Identifies the intent behind user queries using Hugging Face's `distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english` model.
- **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: Extracts key entities from queries using SpaCy's `en_core_web_sm` model.
- **Response Generation**: Predicts suitable responses using a fine-tuned BERT model.
- **API-First Approach**: Interact with the chatbot via a REST API built with Flask.

## Dataset

This project uses the [Customer Support Tweets Dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/MohammadOthman/mo-customer-support-tweets-945k), which contains customer queries and corresponding company responses for training and testing.
